# Home Automation

This project contains my home automation projects.


## MiLight

Scans if a specific device is turned on and turns on the MiLight if it's after the sunset or schedules to turn on the
MiLight after the sunset.


## Wireless Socket

Scans if a specific device is turned on/off and turns on/off the wireless socket.


## Mono

Packs the MiLight and Wireless-Socket projects into one application. This is done to save memory (since it runs on a 
Raspberry) and so that not every program does it's own device scan.


## MiLight Web

Connects to a MiLight-Wifi-Box and provides a website to control the MiLight.
